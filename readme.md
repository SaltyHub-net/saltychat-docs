# Salty Chat
Salty Chat is a TeamSpeak voice plugin which adds more realism to your gamemode (like GTA 5 FiveM/RAGEMP).
In order to serve a wide range of mods, the plugin provides a WebSocket server, which allows bidirectional communication.
Due to the possibility of communication in both directions, the plugin can also send "State Trigger" (player speaks, microphone muted/unmuted, sound muted/unmuted and more).

We provide resources for some mods and also maintain them.
Since it is impossible for us to provide a resource for every mod and every framework, we need your help.
If you write resources for certain mods or frameworks that we haven't covered, you are welcome to add them to our resources list through a pull request.

You can help us to improve our docs by contributing via pull requests - we appreciate any contribution.

# Versioning and Update Branches
With version 0.4.0 we introduce a new versioning schema for Salty Chat.  
Versions within the same major version will be compatible with each other, even if there are changes like new features or fixes.

```
0.4.0
| | |
| | --- Patch (fixes and changes)
| --- Minor (new features)
--- Major (incompatible changes)
```

Any update will be tested in our multi-stage release process:

Branch | Description
------------ | -------------
Stable | Any change is tested in the previous branches and was found to be stable.
Testing | Public testing branch, where all changes can be tested. We recommend that this branch is only used by developers, who are familiar with the plugin and can debug any issues.
Preview | Private testing branch, where **untested** changes are made. Versions using this branch are distributed by Salty Chat developers and are meant to test specific changes, before releasing them to the testing branch.

# TeamSpeak Server Settings
To avoid issues with your TeamSpeak server, we recommend the following settings:
* Manage Virtual Server --> `Misc` tab --> `Min clients in channel before silence`: More then your server slots
* Adjust anti-flood
   * Method 1: Manage Virtual Server --> `Anti-Flood` tab --> adjust values as needed
   * Method 2: Set `b_client_ignore_antiflood` permission flag to the group your users are in
