# Salty Chat
Salty Chat is a TeamSpeak voice plugin which adds more realism to your gamemode (like GTA 5 FiveM/RAGEMP).
In order to serve a wide range of mods, the plugin provides a WebSocket server, which allows bidirectional communication.
Due to the possibility of communication in both directions, the plugin can also send "State Trigger" (player speaks, microphone muted/unmuted, sound muted/unmuted and more).

We provide resources for some mods and also maintain them.
Since it is impossible for us to provide a resource for every mod and every framework, we need your help.
If you write resources for certain mods or frameworks that we haven't covered, you are welcome to add them to our resources list through a pull request.

You can help us to improve our docs by contributing via pull requests - we appreciate any contribution.

* Clean looping of sounds
* Global overwriting of sounds (`%appdata%\TS3Client\plugins\SaltyChat\override`)
* Fallback if a file is missing (override > specified sound pack > default sound pack)

## Swiss Channels
In the [initiate command](/commands.md#1--initiate) there is the possibility to declare TeamSpeak channels as swiss channels.\
Swiss channels are channels in which the plugin keeps the original name of the client and does not move them into the ingame channel.\
For example, support channels can be set as swiss channels, which gives you the ability to move users out of the in-game channel without them having to leave the game first.\
After declaring a channel as swiss channel, all it's sub-channels will be a swiss channel as well.

# Configuration file
When the plugin is starting, the configuration file under `%appdata%\TS3Client\plugins\SaltyChat\settings.json` will be loaded an applied.
Here are various options that can be customized:

Parameter | Description
------------ | -------------
WebSocketAddress | Address and port on which the WebSocket server binds
UpdateBranch | Update branch which is queried for a new version through our version API
OriginExceptions | Exceptions for the source of a WebSocket connection - e.g. you surf on gaming.v10networks.com, locally executed JavaScript can connect to the WebSocket, whereby the source would then be `https://gaming.v10networks.com`
InstanceTimeout | Time in seconds after which the instance will reset without a pong
Is3dEnabled | Enables/disables 3D audio
ExpertMode | Enables/disables export mode in settings menu
LogLevel | Defines how extensive the logging will be (`Error`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Debug` or `Extensive`)
PhoneOffset | Audio mode for phone playback (`Stereo`, `LeftOnly` or `RightOnly`)
RadioOffset | Audio mode for radio playback (`Stereo`, `LeftOnly` or `RightOnly`)
SecondaryRadioOffset | Audio mode for secondary radio playback (`Stereo`, `LeftOnly` or `RightOnly`)
MicClickMode | Overrides `PlayMicClick` property on radio communications (`ScriptDependent`, `Never` or `Always`)

# Versioning and Update Branches
With version 0.4.0 we introduce a new versioning schema for Salty Chat.  
Versions within the same major version will be compatible with each other, even if there are changes like new features or fixes.

```
0.4.0
| | |
| | --- Patch (fixes and changes)
| --- Minor (new features)
--- Major (incompatible changes)
```

Any update will be tested in our multi-stage release process:

Branch | Description
------------ | -------------
Stable | Any change is tested in the previous branches and was found to be stable.
Testing | Public testing branch, where all changes can be tested. We recommend that this branch is only used by developers, who are familiar with the plugin and can debug any issues.
Preview | Private testing branch, where **untested** changes are made. Versions using this branch are distributed by Salty Chat developers and are meant to test specific changes, before releasing them to the testing branch.

# TeamSpeak Server Settings
To avoid issues with your TeamSpeak server, we recommend the following settings:
* Manage Virtual Server --> `Misc` tab --> `Min clients in channel before silence`: More then your server slots
* Adjust anti-flood (only if needed)
   * Method 1: Manage Virtual Server --> `Anti-Flood` tab --> adjust values as needed
   * Method 2: Set `b_client_ignore_antiflood` permission flag to the group your users are in

Ensure that users can whisper among themselves while in the ingame channel. In larger and more restrictive environments, you may not want to give all users permission to whisper. There are ways to solve this with bots, but here are "easy" ones:
* Method 1 (only users in the ingame channel can whisper):
   * Remove the `i_client_whisper_power` permission flag in the group to which your users belong and set `i_client_needed_whisper_power` to, say, 10
   * Edit the permissions for your ingame channel (`Permissions` --> `Channel Permissions` and select the channel on the left) and set `i_client_whisper_power` to 10 (>= needed power from before)
* Method 2 (everony can whisper):
   * Set `i_client_whisper_power` permission flag for your user group >= `i_client_needed_whisper_power` of all your groups
